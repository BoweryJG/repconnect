# Supabase RLS Security Migrations

This directory contains migrations to secure the Supabase database by implementing proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## Migration Files

### 1. `20250110_fix_rls_policies.sql`
- Updates all existing RLS policies that use `(true)` to require authentication
- Removes insecure policies that allow public/anonymous access without authentication
- Updates all policies to check `auth.uid()` is not null
- Converts all policies from `public` role to `authenticated` role
- Fixes service role policies to use proper JWT role checking

### 2. `20250110_add_missing_rls_policies.sql`
- Adds RLS policies to 17 tables that had no policies
- Implements authentication-based access control for all tables
- Ensures service role maintains administrative access
- Creates user-specific policies based on table relationships

### 3. `20250110_secure_demo_data.sql`
- Adds constraints to prevent test/demo data in production
- Implements foreign key constraints to auth.users table
- Adds audit columns (created_by, updated_by, created_at, updated_at)
- Creates triggers for automatic audit trail
- Removes any existing test/demo data
- Adds performance indexes for auth checks

### 4. `20250110_enable_rls_all_tables.sql`
- Ensures RLS is enabled on all tables in the public schema
- Creates monitoring views and functions for RLS compliance
- Implements alerting system for RLS policy violations
- Provides tools to verify security compliance

## Key Security Changes

1. **Authentication Required**: All policies now require `auth.uid()` to be non-null
2. **No Public Access**: Removed all policies that allowed unauthenticated access
3. **Role-Based Access**: Properly implemented role checking using `auth.jwt()->>'role'`
4. **Tenant Isolation**: Enhanced tenant isolation policies with auth checks
5. **Data Integrity**: Added foreign key constraints and audit trails
6. **Compliance Monitoring**: Added tools to monitor and alert on RLS compliance

## Applying the Migrations

To apply these migrations to your Supabase project:

1. Using Supabase CLI:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. Or manually through the Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Run each migration file in order
   - Verify successful execution

## Post-Migration Verification

After applying migrations, verify security:

1. Check RLS status:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM public.rls_status;
   ```

2. Check for compliance issues:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM public.check_rls_compliance();
   ```

3. Review compliance alerts:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM public.rls_compliance_alerts WHERE resolved_at IS NULL;
   ```

## Important Notes

- These migrations will prevent unauthenticated access to all data
- Ensure your application properly authenticates users before making database queries
- Service role access is preserved for backend operations
- Test thoroughly in a development environment before applying to production
