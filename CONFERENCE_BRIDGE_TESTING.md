  - Conference continues without Harvey
  - Error logged in database
  - Rep still gets customer call

- [ ] **Test 9: Conference room failures**

  - Database constraints respected

### 6. Production Load Testing

  - Harvey stays connected throughout
  - Recording and transcription work for long calls
  - No memory leaks or timeouts

### 7. Security Testing

  - No sensitive data in logs

### 8. Monitoring and Alerting

- [ ] **Test 15: Error logging**
  - All errors properly logged
  - Log levels appropriate
  - No sensitive data in logs
  - Monitoring dashboards updated

- [ ] **Test 16: Performance metrics**
  - Call connection times measured
  - Transcription processing times tracked
  - Database query performance acceptable
  - No bottlenecks identified

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] All tests above passed
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Backup plan documented
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested

### Deployment

- [ ] Deploy backend changes
- [ ] Verify webhook endpoints responding
- [ ] Test single end-to-end call
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Verify Harvey connection working

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Monitor first 10 production calls
- [ ] Verify recordings and transcripts
- [ ] Check database performance
- [ ] Confirm Harvey analysis working
- [ ] Document any issues found

## Emergency Procedures

### If Conference Bridge Fails

1. **Immediate Action**: Revert to direct dial
2. **Change webhook**: Use simple `twiml.dial(forwardTo)`
3. **Monitor**: Customer calls still work normally
4. **Fix**: Debug conference issues offline
5. **Redeploy**: When fixes tested and verified

### If Harvey Fails

1. **Calls continue**: Without Harvey coaching
2. **Check logs**: Identify Harvey connection issues
3. **Verify number**: `+19292424535` is reachable
4. **Restart**: Harvey service if needed
5. **Monitor**: Until Harvey fully operational

### If Transcription Fails

1. **Calls work**: Recording still happens
2. **Check API**: Deepgram service status
3. **Verify keys**: Environment variables correct
4. **Retry**: Failed transcriptions manually
5. **Backlog**: Process when service restored
