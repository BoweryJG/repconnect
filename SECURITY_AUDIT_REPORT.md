# Security Audit Report - RepConnect Project

## Executive Summary

This security audit has identified a **CRITICAL** vulnerability in the RepConnect project where an ElevenLabs API key was exposed in git history. The issue has been partially remediated but requires immediate action to completely secure the codebase.

## Critical Security Issues Found

### 1. API Key Exposure in Git History (CRITICAL)

- **Issue**: ElevenLabs API key `sk_178e9e2ea1aea0c7787cd5f3bbe21bc6c293912af43137a4` was hardcoded in source code
- **Location**: `src/services/elevenLabsTTS.ts`
- **Git Commits**:
  - `4e11721` - Initial commit with hardcoded API key
  - `ec67ded` - Commit that removed the hardcoded key (good)
- **Impact**: HIGH - API key is permanently exposed in git history and can be accessed by anyone with repository access
- **Status**: REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION

### 2. Current State Assessment

✅ **RESOLVED**: API key removed from current source code
✅ **RESOLVED**: .env.local uses template values
✅ **RESOLVED**: .env.local properly ignored in .gitignore
✅ **RESOLVED**: .env.example contains proper template

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Rotate the Exposed API Key

```bash
# The following key MUST be rotated immediately:
sk_178e9e2ea1aea0c7787cd5f3bbe21bc6c293912af43137a4
```

### 2. Clean Git History

Run the provided script to remove the API key from git history:

```bash
./remove-secrets-from-history.sh
```

### 3. Update Environment Configuration

Set the new API key in your local environment:

```bash
# In .env.local
REACT_APP_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_new_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

## Security Recommendations

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks

The project already has a good pre-commit hook setup with secret detection:

- `.lintstagedrc.json` includes `check-secrets.js`
- The script checks for various secret patterns
- Consider enhancing the patterns if needed

### 2. Environment Variable Security

- ✅ All sensitive configuration uses environment variables
- ✅ .env files are properly ignored in .gitignore
- ✅ .env.example provides clear templates

### 3. Secret Scanning

The existing `scripts/check-secrets.js` script detected some false positives but is working correctly. Consider:

- Adding more specific patterns for ElevenLabs API keys
- Implementing automated secret scanning in CI/CD

### 4. Access Control

- Review who has access to the repository
- Consider using repository secrets for CI/CD instead of environment variables
- Implement proper access controls for production environments

## Files Checked

### Environment Files

- `.env.local` - ✅ Secure (uses templates)
- `.env.example` - ✅ Secure (proper templates)
- `.env.agentbackend` - ✅ Secure (no secrets)

### Source Code

- `src/services/elevenLabsTTS.ts` - ✅ Secure (uses env vars)
- All other source files - ✅ No hardcoded secrets found

### Git History

- ❌ **CRITICAL**: API key exposed in commits `4e11721` and `ec67ded`

## Remediation Status

- [x] Identify exposed API key
- [x] Confirm current code is secure
- [x] Verify .gitignore configuration
- [x] Update secret removal script
- [ ] **PENDING**: Execute git history cleanup
- [ ] **PENDING**: Rotate ElevenLabs API key
- [ ] **PENDING**: Update production environment

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Rotate the ElevenLabs API key
2. **URGENT**: Run `./remove-secrets-from-history.sh` to clean git history
3. **URGENT**: Force push cleaned history to remote repository
4. **URGENT**: Notify all team members to re-clone repository
5. **MEDIUM**: Update production environment with new API key
6. **LOW**: Consider implementing additional security measures

## Conclusion

While the current codebase is secure, the exposed API key in git history poses a significant security risk. The provided remediation steps will fully resolve this issue. The project already has good security practices in place with proper environment variable usage and secret detection.

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Execute remediation steps immediately.
