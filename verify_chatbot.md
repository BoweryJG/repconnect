# RepConnect Chatbot Verification Steps

## What I Fixed:

1. **ChatbotIntegration.tsx** - Now uses the configured API client instead of hardcoded fetch
2. **agentChatAPI.js** - Added `credentials: 'include'` to all API calls for proper authentication

## To Verify It's Working:

1. **Start the app**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open in browser**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Look for the chatbot launcher** - It should appear in the bottom-right corner

4. **Click the chatbot** - You should see:
   - A list of 28 agents to choose from
   - Agents like "Alexis Rivera", "Coach Alex", "Harvey Specter", etc.

5. **Select an agent and chat** - Messages should work properly

## Check Browser Console:

Open DevTools (F12) and look for these success messages:

- "Found 28 agents from backend"
- "Backend response status: 200"
- No CORS errors

## API Endpoints Being Used:

- **Agents**: https://osbackend-zl1h.onrender.com/api/repconnect/agents ✅
- **Chat**: https://osbackend-zl1h.onrender.com/api/repconnect/chat/public/message ✅

## If There Are Issues:

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Make sure you're on http://localhost:3000 (not https)
