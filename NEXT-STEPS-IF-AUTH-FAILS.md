# Next Steps if Auth Callback Still Doesn't Work

## 1. Check Supabase Dashboard

- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Check Authentication > Logs for errors
- Verify Redirect URLs include: `https://repconnect.repspheres.com/auth/callback`

## 2. Debug with Chrome DevTools

Run: `node debug-auth-callback.js`

- Check Console tab for errors
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Check Application > Local Storage for auth tokens

## 3. Compare with Working Canvas App

- Canvas DOES NOT call setSession() manually
- Canvas uses the EXACT SAME Supabase project
- Canvas auth callback works perfectly

## 4. Nuclear Option - Copy Canvas AuthCallback Exactly

```typescript
// Just copy Canvas AuthCallback.tsx exactly
// It's proven to work with the same Supabase setup
```

## 5. Check for Other Interference

- Is AuthContext doing something weird?
- Is there a middleware intercepting?
- Is there a route guard blocking?

## 6. Add More Logging

```typescript
// In supabase.ts
auth: {
  debug: true, // Enable Supabase debug logs
  // ... other settings
}
```

## 7. Test Locally First

```bash
npm start
# Test auth callback locally
# Check console for errors
```

## 8. If All Else Fails

The issue is NOT in AuthCallback anymore. Check:

- Supabase configuration
- Route configuration
- AuthContext session handling
- Any middleware or guards

## Key Insight

Canvas uses the SAME Supabase project and their AuthCallback is simpler than ours was. We've now matched their pattern. If it still doesn't work, the problem is elsewhere in the system.
