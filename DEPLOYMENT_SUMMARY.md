# ðŸš€ RepConnect - Ready for Deployment

## Build Status: âœ… SUCCESS

Build completed at: 2025-07-11 09:25

### Build Output
- **Build folder size**: Optimized production build ready
- **Main bundle**: 613.56 kB (gzipped)
- **Build warnings**: Only ESLint warnings (non-critical)
- **All assets compiled successfully**

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Frontend (Netlify)
The build is ready in the `build/` folder.

**Manual Deploy:**
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Drag and drop the `build/` folder
3. Or use Netlify CLI: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=build`

**Git Deploy:**
1. Push to your connected Git repository
2. Netlify will auto-deploy using settings in `netlify.toml`

### 2. Backend (Already on Render)
According to your docs, backend is already deployed on Render.
Just ensure environment variables are set.

### 3. Environment Variables
Make sure all required variables from `REQUIRED_ENV_VARS.md` are set in:
- Netlify dashboard â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables
- Render dashboard â†’ Environment

## Post-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Verify frontend loads at your Netlify URL
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors
- [ ] Test login functionality
- [ ] Verify API calls reach backend
- [ ] Test WebRTC/calling features
- [ ] Monitor health endpoint: `https://[backend-url]/health`

## Known Issues (Non-Critical)
- ESLint warnings in build (unused variables)
- Bundle size warning (can be optimized later with code splitting)
- Some npm vulnerabilities (non-critical, mostly in dev dependencies)
