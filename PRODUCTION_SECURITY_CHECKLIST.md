- [ ] Enable audit logging

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up error tracking service (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Configure application monitoring
- [ ] Set up security event logging
- [ ] Create alerting for suspicious activities

### Additional Security Measures

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive data is in environment variables
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **XSS Prevention**: HTML content is properly escaped
4. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Special characters are escaped
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks
6. **Error Handling**: Errors don't expose sensitive information
7. **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data uses secure storage methods
8. **CORS Configuration**: Restricts cross-origin requests
9. **File Upload Security**: Validates file types and sizes
10. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures

## Deployment Instructions

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in production values
2. Ensure all environment variables are set on the production server
3. Build the application with `npm run build`
4. Deploy with security headers configured on the server
5. Enable HTTPS and redirect all HTTP traffic
6. Configure rate limiting on the server/CDN level
7. Set up monitoring and alerting
8. Perform security testing before going live

## Important Notes

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Rotate all API keys and tokens regularly
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Keep all packages updated with security patches
- Review security logs regularly
- Have an incident response plan ready
