# Call Forwarding Setup Guide ðŸ“ž

This guide will help you set up call forwarding so that calls to your Twilio number ring on your personal phone.

## Prerequisites
- Twilio account with phone number
- Your Twilio credentials already configured

## Step 1: Add Your Phone Number to Netlify

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your `repconnect1` site
3. Go to **Site configuration** â†’ **Environment variables**
4. Add a new variable:
   - **Key**: `FORWARD_TO_PHONE`
   - **Value**: `+1XXXXXXXXXX` (your phone number with country code)
   - Example: `+14155551234`

## Step 2: Configure Twilio Phone Number

1. Log into your Twilio Console: https://console.twilio.com
2. Go to **Phone Numbers** â†’ **Manage** â†’ **Active Numbers**
3. Click on your phone number
4. In the **Voice Configuration** section:
   - **Configure with**: Webhooks, TwiML Bins, Functions, Studio, or Proxy
   - **A call comes in**: Webhook
   - **URL**: `https://repconnect1.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/incoming-call`
   - **HTTP Method**: POST
5. Click **Save Configuration**

## Step 3: Test Your Setup

1. Call your Twilio phone number from any phone
2. You should hear: "Thank you for calling RepConnect. Connecting you now."
3. Your personal phone should ring with the Twilio number as the caller ID
4. Answer the call to complete the connection

## How It Works

When someone calls your Twilio number:
1. Twilio sends a webhook to your Netlify function
2. The function returns TwiML instructions to forward the call
3. Twilio forwards the call to your personal phone
4. You see the Twilio number as caller ID (so you know it's a business call)

## Optional Features

### Custom Greeting
Edit the greeting message in `/netlify/functions/incoming-call.js`:
```javascript
twiml.say({
  voice: 'alice'
}, 'Your custom greeting here.');
```

### Call Screening
You can add call screening by modifying the dial options:
```javascript
const dial = twiml.dial({
  callerId: To,
  timeout: 30,
  screenCall: true, // Enables call screening
});
```

### Multiple Phone Numbers
To ring multiple phones simultaneously:
```javascript
dial.number('+14155551234');
dial.number('+14155555678');
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **No incoming calls**: Check that your Twilio webhook URL is correct
2. **Call fails immediately**: Verify FORWARD_TO_PHONE is set in Netlify
3. **Wrong caller ID**: The caller will see your Twilio number, not the original caller

## Costs

- Incoming calls to Twilio number: ~$0.0085/minute
- Outbound call to your phone: ~$0.013/minute
- Total: ~$0.02/minute for forwarded calls
